Vanilla changelog <developer's cut>
===================================

v-1.1
=====

    Upgrade
    =======
    In order for one to upgrade Vanilla to this version one needs to add the PHP
    RESPONSIVILLE_AUTO_INIT definition to config.php and move the Javascript 
    global variables RESPONSIVILLE_DEBUG and RESPONSIVILLE_AUTO_INIT to the head
    element.

    - The Responsiville auto init settings is now controlled via a PHP flag
      named RESPONSIVILLE_AUTO_INIT, which is set in config.php. This way the
      developers needs not worry about any additional knowledge of how to 
      initialise the Responsiville framework within the Vanilla framework.

    - Added RESPONSIVILLE_DEBUG flag in order to differentiate it from the
      VANILLA_DEBUG flag (which is not yet used).

    - All flags are now consistently declared in the config.php.

    - Added Vanilla widgets which are generic widgets that are meant to be easy
      to implement via ACF.

    - Removed Pressidium Varnish cache purge addon.

    - Corrected Nevma jQuery popup plugin bug when unbinding scroll events, due
      to newer jQuery version.

    - Removed ini set debug flags from config.php and put the WordPress debug
      defines in the wp-config.php.

    - A wp_nav_menu should have an extra resposniville-megamenu argument set to
      true in order for the respective responsiville megamenu element to be
      activated on it.

    - Put the fix CSS vars script inside Vanilla and removed it from the theme's
      functions.js file for future conistency.
