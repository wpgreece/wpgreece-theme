v-1.5
=====

  - Added an extra, more flexible greek months declined function.

  - Added a full set of functions to retrieve an image's alt for HTML looking
    up all its possible string attributes.
  
  - Cleaned up the Vanilla base TinyMCE files.

  - Replaced CSS property break-word with overflow-wrap (value break-word).

  - Re-arranged directories inside /inc so that code is separated a little 
    better.

  - Started adding Vanilla PHP constants that control various settings. 

  - Enqueueing JS and CSS has become more compact, with only one declaration of
    each file at each point. 

  - BWP minification has become as compact as possible (one file in the head
    and one file in the footer).



v-1.4
=====

  - Updated Responsiville to version 1.4.

  - Patched the CSSUtilities library so that it does not replaces new lines in
    minified files with a space. Before it simply stripped them away, thus
    making strings to stick to one another.

  - Added SVGs to the list of allowed upload mime types.

  - Enhanced frontend search is not activated by default. Its filter must be
    manually set to rerun true. It is preferred to use plugins which do the same
    instead. The functionality is kept here for specific cases. 

  - Enhanced frontend search in order to be able to search inside all the 
    postmeta at once with a "*" notation.

  - Responsiville megamenus that automatically run on WordPress menus can now 
    propagate their initialisation attributes.

  - Added Jetpack disable frontend CSS concatenation filter, so that Jetpack
    features' CSS files are loaded separately and only when a feature is
    actually enabled. 

  - Hid Post types order and Taxonomies order plugins little images that
    appeared in admin menus. 

  - Changed the `vanilla_search_` filters to `vanilla_frontend_search_`.



v-1.3
=====

  - No upgrade issues. 

  - Updated Responsiville to version 1.3.

  - Moved fallback Facebook featured image to the bottom of the HEAD so that
    wp_head should get the chance to set it first. 

  - Removed the frontend admin bar global cancellation.

  - Patched the CSSUtilities library so that when CSS files from third party 
    domains are requested and the request fails the error is caught and the 
    script casually contnues in order to handle the current domain's CSS.

  - Enhanced our usage of the CSSUtilities library to handle nested CSS
    variables as well. Previously it could not handle a CSS variable that
    contained another CS variable inside it. However, CSS variables are still 
    only taken care of in the root element!

  - Added a "skip_missing" argument to the vanilla_wpml_language_switcher
    function so that it is exposed to the theme developer.

  - Corrected a bug in CSS variables replacement script, where the equalheights
    element needed to run once more, after the CSS variables had been replaced
    and caused the heights of elements to change as well. 

  - Added a hook that protects direct file access to Gravity Forms uploads.



v-1.2
=====

    Upgrade
    =======
    - All scripts in config.php.
    - No scripts in theme header or footer.
    - Responsiville flags in config.php.
    - No Responsiville flags in theme header or footer.

    - Added Vanilla widgets which can play nicely with ACF fields.



v-1.1
=====

    Upgrade
    =======
    In order for one to upgrade Vanilla to this version one needs to add the
    PHP RESPONSIVILLE_AUTO_INIT definition to config.php and move the
    Javascript global variables RESPONSIVILLE_DEBUG and RESPONSIVILLE_AUTO_INIT
    to the head element.

    - The Responsiville auto init settings is now controlled via a PHP flag
      named RESPONSIVILLE_AUTO_INIT, which is set in config.php. This way the
      developers needs not worry about any additional knowledge of how to 
      initialise the Responsiville framework within the Vanilla framework.

    - Added RESPONSIVILLE_DEBUG flag in order to differentiate it from the
      VANILLA_DEBUG flag (which is not yet used).

    - All flags are now consistently declared in the config.php.

    - Added Vanilla widgets which are generic widgets that are meant to be easy
      to implement via ACF.

    - Removed Pressidium Varnish cache purge addon.

    - Corrected Nevma jQuery popup plugin bug when unbinding scroll events, due
      to newer jQuery version.

    - Removed ini set debug flags from config.php and put the WordPress debug
      defines in the wp-config.php.

    - A wp_nav_menu should have an extra resposniville-megamenu argument set to
      true in order for the respective responsiville megamenu element to be
      activated on it.

    - Put the fix CSS vars script inside Vanilla and removed it from the
      theme's functions.js file for future conistency.

v-1.0
=====

    - Added accordion shortcode to the TinyMCE via a button.

    - Created a special page area for demoing Responsiville components.

    - Incorporated latest Responsiville changes.

    - Lots of stuff, but we were not keeping a log those days, sorry.

    - It's the beginning of a fantastic journey.
