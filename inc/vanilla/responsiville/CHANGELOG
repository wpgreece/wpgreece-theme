v-1.5
================
since 01/12/2018

  - Popup element has been added.

  - Vertical rhythm in text components is now handled on a sibling elements
    logic. Each text element gets a top margin relative to its previous text
    element in the DOM. 
  
  - Added image loading handling utility and using it in all places where we 
    need to act after an image or a set of images have finished loading. 



v-1.4
================
since 22/11/2017

  - Parallax element has become mature. 

  - Mobimenu calls Drawers menu inside it automatically. 

  - Bug fixes here and there. 

  - Added more icons to the Responsiville icon font.

  - Added a keyword text search to the icon font demo.

  - Fixed scrollmenu bug, when scrolling up the offsetTop was not taken into
    account correctly. 

  - Fixed scrollmenu and parallax bug when calculating page scroll position
    cross browser. 

  - Added $document variable to the list of important cached page elements of
    each Responsiville module.

  - Fixed a slideshow bug where the module was not actually waiting for the
    images inside the first slide to load before becoming enabled (when the
    corresponding wait option had been set to true).

  - Fixed bug in Mobimenu where the element ran on its own cloned element, after
    it had run from within a Scrollmenu element.



v-1.3
================
since 01/06/2017

  - No upgrade issues. 

  - All Responsiville elements have a 'responsiville-api' data attribute, which
    is saved on the main DOM element of the Responsiville element, and exposes
    the full Responsiville object to the developer for custom handling. 

  - Enter/leave values of Responsiville elements can now be used autonomously,
    without having to set them both, when declaring the elements. Also, 
    shorthand properties can be used like "laptop >>", "<< tablet", "*".

  - Reduced the default Responsiville throttle time to 100ms, from 250ms.

  - Slideshow slides are wrapped in a container of their own, so that they can
    be separated from the rest of the slideshow DOM elements. 

  - Fixed an Equalheights bug when the elements that are to be made equalheights
    simply are not there at all.

  - When Scrollmenu runs automatically, which is the default, has been changed 
    to run before the Mobimenu and the Megamenu. The reason is that it also
    checks inside its elements for possible Mobimenus and Megamenus and, if it
    were left to run after them, it would create them twice. Also, for the same
    reason, the Mobimenu and the Megamenu, when running on an element, check
    first if they have possibly already ran on that element and stop.

  - Corrected Responsiville Accordion open/close events.

  - Added a Responsiville custom responsive object facility, via a function
    Responsiville.createResponsiveObject( obj ), which extends any given object
    with enter/leave states that correspond to enable/disable functions.

  - Added Slideshow slide left and right transition effect.

  - Added a Megamenu 'slide-ltr' option for left-to-right slide effect of the
    megamenu element.

  - Megamenu and Mobimenu anchor elements that contain a hash (#) are treated
    depending on the fact whether their "href" attribute points to an actual
    page element or is simply there for structural purposes. 

  - Added a Responsiville Parallax effects element.

  - Added a Responsiville Drawers element.

  - Added a Responsivill Responsiveelements module to cater for 

  - Added Mobimenu opening and closing classes.

  - Added Responsiville Accordion panels opening and closing classes.

  - Started a Responsiville Popup element.

  - Element slugs are now defined by automatically advancing counters. Also, 
    slugs are used in element console logging.

  - Continuously updating icon font files. Check the documentation for changes. 

  - Fixed buttons, inputs and selects box dimensions for all browsers and OSs.

  - Documentation updates. 

  - Bug fixing here and there. 



v-1.2
================
since 01/01/2017

    Upgrade notice
    ==============
    1) All scripts in config.php.
    2) No scripts in theme header or footer.
    3) Responsiville flags in config.php.
    4) No Responsiville flags in theme header or footer.

    - Revamped documentation. Finally!

    - Added a z-index property to the Scrollmenu module.

    - Added a slug property to all elements to allow for multiple instances of 
      the same responsiville behaviour.

    - Weird cases appear when a navigation element needs to be a megamenu, a 
      mobimenu and a scrollmenu at the same time. This is because the mobimenu
      and the scrollmenu clone the original element and work on the clone, but
      this way certain selectors coincidentally appear more times that intended
      inside the DOM. For instance, cloning an element, which is meant to be 
      used as a megamenu, for mobimenu behaviour (note that mobimenus run before
      megamenus in Responsiville) makes the element appear twice in the DOM, so,
      when the actual megamenu runs, it will find two megamenus to run on, but
      this is prevented. Also, in the same manner, when the megamenu is in an 
      external container (ie not a sibling of the megamenu activator) and it is 
      also enabled as a scrollmenu, then the cloned megamenu inside the 
      scrollmenu container must be take extra precautions to not confuse the 
      original megamenu container with the megamenu container of the clone.



v-1.1
================
since 01/09/2016

    Upgrade notice
    ==============
    In order for one to upgrade Vanilla to this version of Responsiville one
    needs to follow these three steps:

    1) Set the RESPONSIVILLE_DEBUG and RESPONSIVILLE_AUTO_INIT global 
       settings right before the Responsiville scripts are output.
    2) Remove the Responsiville initialisation declarations because the
       framework now automatically initialises.
    3) Set the correct classes to the HTML elements that define each
       Responsiville module because these modules now automatically 
       initialise.

    - Added push and pull grid classes to visually reorder columns as per 
      breakpoint.

    - Responsiville and its modules are now intialised in a separate script file
      named responsiville.run.js.

    - Responsiville is now adjusted to the current breakpoint  immediately, when
      it is set to run automatically, and does not wait for the DOMContentLoaded
      event to fire. 

    - Responsiville main debug settings are now held in a global variable named
      RESPONSIVILLE_DEBUG which can be declared before the framework itself.

    - Responsiville auto init settings are now held in global variable named
      RESPONSIVILLE_AUTO_INIT which can be declared before the framework scripts
      are included in the page HTML.

    - Responsiville modules can now be initialized via data attributes in the
      main element that defines each module.

    - Added generic event handling mechanism for all Responsiville modules.

    - All events of the Responsiville framework and its modules are now handled
      by the uniform event handling mechanism.

    - Added important events and callbacks for all Responsiville modules.

    - Previous event handlers of the Responsiville Main module have now been
      competely replaced with the new uniform way of event handling.

    - First versions of the event mechanism had a bug where only the last of the
      function callback were called. This is now fixed.

    - Now only the breakpoint from which the page left and the one to which the
      page ended up in trigger the respective `enter.xxxxx` and `leave.xxxxx`
      events.

    - Mobimenu now clones the original menu element to allow for style and
      animations separation.

    - Mobimenu now creates the burger menu as a sibling of the original menu
      element. This way, when the original menu is hidden, the burger menu seems
      to have replaced it. However the mobimenu should be placed within an
      independent container that handles its general layout. 

    - Mobimenu now acts as a general offcanvas element. A special parameter 
      controls whether its contents are actually styled or not.

    - Megamenu observes DOM for changes to see if new elements have appeared
      that need to be handled by it.

    - Megamenu adds an active class to the activator when it is active.

    - Equalheights now has an enabled and disabled state.

    - Equalheights can now equalise children inside the selected elements, and
      even many groups of children at the same time.

    - Added "device" and "pc" classes to the HTML element to denote whether the
      current device is a PC or a phone/tablet.

    - Slideshow hickups partially fixed due to better setTimeout handling. Bug
      of hidden slide if disabling while in slideshow transition remains.

    - Slideshow now automatically creates the necessary navigation inside it.

    - Started adding code examples in HTML and beautifying them.



v-1.0
================
since 01/07/2016

    - Refactored framework so that it can auto initialise.

    - All framework modules can now auto initialise by using predefined classes,
      which are expected to be found in the DOM inside the elements where the 
      developer wants to activate them on.

    - Grew default moressette buttons a bit.

    - Nevma jQuery greek uppercase plugin now runs correctly on its predefined
      classes. Used to have a bug there.

    - Nevma jQuery no scroll layer plugin now runs correctly on its predefined
      classes.  Used to have a bug there.

    - Init events have been added to the framework on the Responsiville Main
      object. This lead to some code refactoring in order to ensure that the 
      framework runs immediately but its core functionality happens after the
      DOMContentLoaded event.

    - Framework used to sometimes require a phoney window resize trigger in
      order for the init callback to run. Now it doesn't. 

    - Buttons and input elements now have the same total dimensions in their 
      natural sizes.

    - Scrollmenu fixHeight property no longer necessary because the fixed
      element is now a clone of the original and the original is no longer 
      detached from the page flow.

    - Scrollmenu now clones the element it works on. 

    - Scrollmenu checks inside the elements it handles for possible mobimenus or
      megamenus in order to set them up. 

    - Inserted by hand a '.menu-item-has-children > a' selector in the megamenu
      initialising function so that WordPress menus are handled automatically. 

    - When adding a callback to the Responsiville Main object for when a 
      breakpoint changes (or entered or left) then, if the browser is already in
      that breakpoint, the callback is called immediately at that moment for the
      first time. This is because many of the framework's modules are enabled
      when certain breakpoints are entered and it is perfectly natural that a
      module might be called a lot later after the page has loaded.
