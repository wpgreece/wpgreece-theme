v-1.1
================
since 01/09/2016

    Upgrade
    =======
    In order for one to upgrade Vanilla to this version of Responsiville one
    needs to follow these three steps:

    1) Set the RESPONSIVILLE_DEBUG and RESPONSIVILLE_AUTO_INIT global 
       settings right before the Responsiville scripts are output.
    2) Remove the Responsiville initialisation declarations because the
       framework now automatically initialises.
    3) Set the correct classes to the HTML elements that define each
       Responsiville module because these modules now automatically 
       initialise.

    - Added push and pull grid classes to visually reorder columns as per 
      breakpoint.

    - Responsiville and its modules are now intialised in a separate script file
      named responsiville.run.js.

    - Responsiville is now adjusted to the current breakpoint  immediately, when
      it is set to run automatically, and does not wait for the DOMContentLoaded
      event to fire. 

    - Responsiville main debug settings are now held in a global variable named
      RESPONSIVILLE_DEBUG which can be declared before the framework itself.

    - Responsiville auto init settings are now held in global variable named
      RESPONSIVILLE_AUTO_INIT which can be declared before the framework scripts
      are included in the page HTML.

    - Responsiville modules can now be initialized via data attributes in the
      main element that defines each module.

    - Added generic event handling mechanism for all Responsiville modules.

    - All events of the Responsiville framework and its modules are now handled
      by the uniform event handling mechanism.

    - Added important events and callbacks for all Responsiville modules.

    - Previous event handlers of the Responsiville Main module have now been
      competely replaced with the new uniform way of event handling.

    - First versions of the event mechanism had a bug where only the last of the
      function callback were called. This is now fixed.

    - Now only the breakpoint from which the page left and the one to which the
      page ended up in trigger the respective `enter.xxxxx` and `leave.xxxxx`
      events.

    - Mobimenu now clones the original menu element to allow for style and
      animations separation.

    - Mobimenu now creates the burger menu as a sibling of the original menu
      element. This way, when the original menu is hidden, the burger menu seems
      to have replaced it. However the mobimenu should be placed within an
      independent container that handles its general layout. 

    - Mobimenu now acts as a general offcanvas element. A special parameter 
      controls whether its contents are actually styled or not.

    - Megamenu observes DOM for changes to see if new elements have appeared
      that need to be handled by it.

    - Megamenu adds an active class to the activator when it is active.

    - Equalheights now has an enabled and disabled state.

    - Equalheights can now equalise children inside the selected elements, and
      even many groups of children at the same time.

    - Added "device" and "pc" classes to the HTML element to denote whether the
      current device is a PC or a phone/tablet.

    - Slideshow hickups partially fixed due to better setTimeout handling. Bug
      of hidden slide if disabling while in slideshow transition remains.

    - Slideshow now automatically creates the necessary navigation inside it.

    - Started adding code examples in HTML and beautifying them.



v-1.0
================
since 01/07/2016

    - Refactored framework so that it can auto initialise.

    - All framework modules can now auto initialise by using predefined classes,
      which are expected to be found in the DOM inside the elements where the 
      developer wants to activate them on.

    - Grew default moressette buttons a bit.

    - Nevma jQuery greek uppercase plugin now runs correctly on its predefined
      classes. Used to have a bug there.

    - Nevma jQuery no scroll layer plugin now runs correctly on its predefined
      classes.  Used to have a bug there.

    - Init events have been added to the framework on the Responsiville Main
      object. This lead to some code refactoring in order to ensure that the 
      framework runs immediately but its core functionality happens after the
      DOMContentLoaded event.

    - Framework used to sometimes require a phoney window resize trigger in
      order for the init callback to run. Now it doesn't. 

    - Buttons and input elements now have the same total dimensions in their 
      natural sizes.

    - Scrollmenu fixHeight property no longer necessary because the fixed
      element is now a clone of the original and the original is no longer 
      detached from the page flow.

    - Scrollmenu now clones the element it works on. 

    - Scrollmenu checks inside the elements it handles for possible mobimenus or
      megamenus in order to set them up. 

    - Inserted by hand a '.menu-item-has-children > a' selector in the megamenu
      initialising function so that WordPress menus are handled automatically. 

    - When adding a callback to the Responsiville Main object for when a 
      breakpoint changes (or entered or left) then, if the browser is already in
      that breakpoint, the callback is called immediately at that moment for the
      first time. This is because many of the framework's modules are enabled
      when certain breakpoints are entered and it is perfectly natural that a
      module might be called a lot later after the page has loaded.
